# connect-four
This is a two player connect four game that leverages arrays, decisions and loops. 
The game board is set up as a 2D array that gets automatically filled up with the players' inputs. A winner is declared when a player gets 4 in a row, but if no player wins, then a tie is declared. The program currently takes in an input file of moves.
